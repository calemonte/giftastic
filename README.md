# Movie Gif-o-Matic
A dynamic web app that populates the page with gifs pulled from the GIPHY API and movie information pulled from the OMDB API. 

* Click one of the buttons at the top of the page to see gifs from that movie appear below, as well as key information about the movie on the right-hand side. 
* You can add your own movie button using the "Add a Movie" button (don't forget to click it!). 
* To see a gif in action, hover over it. 
* You can add your favorites to a simple list, located in the bottom-right hand corner, by clicking the favorites button when hovering over a gif. 

This app was written in JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap (my first foray in a while), and HTML/CSS.
